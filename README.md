📌 To-Do List App (React + Vite)

🚀 Overview
This is a simple To-Do List application built using React and Vite. It allows users to:
✅ Add tasks
✅ Mark tasks as completed
✅ Delete tasks
✅ Store tasks in local storage (optional)

⚡ Why Vite?
Vite is a modern build tool that offers:

Fast development with hot module replacement (HMR)
Optimised production builds
Lightweight and efficient setup
📝 Features

🔹 Adding Tasks
Users can type a task into the input field and press "Add" to include it in the list.
🔹 Marking Tasks as Completed
Clicking on a task toggles its completed status, changing its appearance (e.g., strikethrough).
🔹 Deleting Tasks
Users can remove tasks by clicking the Delete button next to each task.
🔹 Local Storage (Optional Feature)
The app can save tasks to local storage, so they persist after refreshing the page.
